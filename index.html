									<h2> Asylum</h2>
									<p>This game was the first full game I made with a group of 6 people.<br />
									I was in charge of producing, some of the level design, and taking all assets and incorporating<br />
									them into the game itself. It is a horror game where you have to reach the safe room without<br />
									without getting caught by any of the monsters. It gets harder as you progress with more creatures.</p>

										<h2>Portals2D</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="assets/Games/Portals2D/Portals2D.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I made this game during my first year of college for my 2D game class final. This was the first time I had coded and had done my own art for a game.
										It was a solo project made entirely in GameMakerStudio2. It is a 2D adaptation of the popular game portals.

										<h2>Board of War</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="assets/Games/BoardofWar/Board.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Board of War is a four player game that I had made through Tabletop Simulator with two other people.
										It is a board game where you try and conquer the board and win by obtaining certain squares.
										You will need tabletop simulator to play it, but the rules document and sample play are provided.

										Board Adaptation</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="assets/Games/Moonlighter Card Adaptation/DungeonDelving.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project me and a friend tried to challenge ourselves by taking a game we liked, which was Moonlighter,
										and turning it into a boardgame version. This was another game on tabletop simulator so feel free to look at the
										documentation provided.

										<h2>Jammo's Quest</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="assets/Games/Stuck in a Loop Game Jam/StuckinaLoop.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This game was a game jam for Ludum Dare's Stuck in a Loop game jam. I worked on this game with two others,
										where I did level design and a majority of integration of assets. The game is a puzzle game that works by
										deactivating your body and respawning at a checkpoint to allow you to use yourself to get to different places.
